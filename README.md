This is my To Do list application that allows you to create a to do list. You can add items to the list with the .append function. I also have it where you can delete tasks as needed with the .remove function. Once the user selects and number from the main menu it will allow them to keep that doing things to that part or allows user to exit back to the main menu and once the user is done completely it gives a final message thanking the user for using my app. Hope you guys enjoy!
